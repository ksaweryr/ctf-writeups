## Solution
File `challenge.txt` contains the following text:
```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789_{}

5 19 27
10 19 24
11 6 16

A8FC7A{H7_ZODCEND_8F_CCQV_RTTVHD}
```
Using the challenge's name, the Hill cipher, which uses a square matrix in the encryption process, can be easily found. It is then possible to decode the flag using an [online Hill cipher decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/hill-cipher).

## Flag
`LITCTF{B3_RUNN1NG_UP_TH4T_H1LLLL}`
